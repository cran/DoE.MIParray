Changes to package DoE.MIParray

Version 0.10, September 26 2017
- single-quoted software names for avoiding "potentially mis-spelled" note
- added URLs for installation instructions for packages gurobi and Rmosek to the Description file
- added key words to lowerbound_AR documentation

Version 0.9, September 22 2017
- sharpened the lower bound for AR for resolution II
  based on Liu and Lin 2009

Version 0.8, September 04 2017
- incorporated bound for A_R from GrÃ¶mping and Xu (2014) Theorem 5
  into gurobi_MIParray and mosek_MIParray; this allows to avoid potentially
  lengthy confirmations of optimality, where all R factor projections have weak strength R.
  Initially, the functions lowerbounds and lowerbound_AR are included here;
  eventually, they will be moved to package DoE.base.
- made sure to export a reduced MIPinfo attribute if only an early phase in a multiphase optimization
  did not achieve optimality (nothing was output for mosek_MIParray and gurobi_MIParray before)
- changed the order of the list elements in the MIPinfo attribute for gurobi_ functions to match that of
  mosek_ functions, and placed info element last in MIPinfo also for gurobi
- switched to Mosek version 8.1.0.23, which implies a change in the presolve option
- added check for generated integer variables to mosek_MIParray and mosek_MIPcontinue
  (through utility mosek_modelAddConeQobj),
  since starting values for integer variables (even derived ones from presolve) need to be integer;
  this improves the situation, but does not cover all situations for which implicit integers
  cause trouble --> wait for Mosek version 9 to hopefully resolve the problem
- made the MIPcontinue functions use upper bounds from previous runs for improve=TRUE cases
- exported print.oa function from DoE.base
  (had to define it within DoE.MIParray for that purpose, since DoE.base does not export it)
- added tests to the inst directory
- fixed a bug in gurobi_MIParray and mosek_MIParray regarding feasibility checks for resolution I designs
- fixed a bug in mosek_MIPcontinue

Version 0.7, August 17 2017
- added option for a start array to gurobi_MIParray
  and mosek_MIParray
- added option for forced elements to gurobi_MIParray
  and mosek_MIParray
- cleaned up unnecessary defaults from gurobi.params
  and mosek.params in all functions
- added overall package documentation file
- combined documentation of gurobi_MIParray and mosek_MIParray
  into one file

Version 0.6, August 15 2017
- added NEWS file
- MIQCPMethod gets default 0
- MIPFocus added as a parameter with default 1 for gurobi_MIParray
  and default 0 for gurobi_MIPcontinue
- heurist and MIPFocus are deactivated for initial linear problem
  in gurobi_MIParray
- store time used for initial linear problem in the info attribute

Version 0.5
- moved functions oa_feasible and print.oa to package DoE.base
- checking feasibility with that function
- MIQCPMethod had default -1
- only heurist was deactivated for initial linear problem
  in gurobi_MIParray

Version 0.4.0
- checking feasibility with function oa_feasible
- fixed a bug which implied that setting MIQCPMethod
  did not work in case of also setting gurobi.params
